# Student Performance Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting student performance based on various factors such as study hours, attendance, previous grades, and other relevant features.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build predictive models that can analyze student data and provide insights into their academic performance. This can help educators and students take proactive measures to improve learning outcomes.

## 🏰️ Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing trends and relationships in the data.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Training and evaluating models such as:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Neural Networks (if applicable)
- **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy, RMSE, R² Score, and other relevant metrics.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation contains various student attributes such as:
- Study hours
- Attendance
- Previous exam scores
- Extracurricular activities
- Socioeconomic factors (if available)

If the dataset is public, please provide a link; otherwise, ensure you have the required permissions before using it.

## 🚀 Usage

- Run the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore data and train models.
- Modify `src/train.py` to experiment with different models and hyperparameters.
- Save the best model and analyze predictions in `results/`.
